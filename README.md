Tasks Included
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

This script:

Attempts to open and read a file named sample.txt.

Displays the file content line by line.

Uses exception handling to gracefully manage the case where the file does not exist.

Prevents the program from crashing and shows a user-friendly error message instead.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

This script:

Accepts user input and writes it to output.txt.

Appends additional user input to the same file on a new line.

Reads and displays the final content of the file after writing and appending.

Demonstrates correct use of file modes:

w → write

a → append

r → read
